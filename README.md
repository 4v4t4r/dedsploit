### I. Introduction

Yes, Watch Dogs has heavily influenced us when writing this framework. This entire project brought upon a lot of the ideals from the Watch Dogs franchise, and even actual hacking culture, to life. This framework aims to exploit and attack some common every-day vulnerabilities, whether it is a misconfiguration of a SSH server, or even the utilization of `apache2` as a web server, which could be subjected to malicious __Slowloris__ DoS attacks.

The framework comprises of several modules, and within each module will be attack vectors.

    main
    |
    +--SSH
    |    +--
    |       |- bruteforce - bruteforce vulnerable SSH server
    |
    +--SMTP
    |     +--
    |        | - bruteforce - bruteforce SMTP address (aka email)
    |        |
    |        | - smsbomb - utilizes smtp-to-email gateway to spam SMS messages
    |
    +--HTTP
    |      +--
    |         | - arpspoof - MITM where user fakes ARP messages on LAN, intercepting packets from host
    |         |
    |         | - slowloris - Layer-7 DoS attack using slow headers and malformed GET requests to a vulnerable web server
    |
    +--Recon
    |       +--
    |          | - pscan - port scan with Nmap
    |          |
    |          | - hosts - scan for active hosts

### II. Installation & Usage

In order to install this program, it is best that you are on a __Linux-based__ distro, preferably __Kali-Linux__.

First, `git clone`.

    git clone https://github.com/ex0dus-0x/dedsploit

Change directory, and then run the installer script (Must be root or have superuser permissions):

    cd /path/to/dedsploit
    sudo python installer.py

The `installer.py` script will install of the necessary dependencies for you. Note that other platforms will be supported in the future (for now, manually install, especially if you don't use `apt-get` as a package manager).

Once finished, execute with:

    dedsploit


Example of the __ssh__ bruteforce module in use:
